# Theory of Computation
- Designing and Implementation of Computational Models:
    1. DFAs & NDFAs
    2. Mealy & Moore machines
    3. Regular Expressions
    4. Context Free Grammars
    5. Push Down Automatas
    6. Turing Machines

## NOTES
- ### 1. Designing and Experimentation
    - Experimented with the help of Java Formal Languages and Automata Package (JFLAP)
    - Can be run bare with 
    ```shell
    java -jar jflap.jar
    ```
    - To open a pre-existing file
    ```shell
    java -jar jflap.jar <file_name>.jff
    ```
- ### 2. Implementation:
    - Implemented using the C programming Language 
    - can be run with 
    ```shell
    gcc <code_file_name>.c -o <code_file_name> && <code_file_name>
    ```

- An Acadmeic Repository for the implementations of theoretical computational models through C programming Language.
